# Contact Form (Flask Project)

	This is a very simple Flask project where users can submit a message through a contact form.  
	All submitted messages are stored in a text file (`messages.txt`) and shown back on the page.

	## Files
	- `app.py` → Flask backend  
	- `contact.html` → Frontend HTML form  
	- `messages.txt` → Stores submitted messages  

	## How to Run
	1. Install Flask if not installed:  
	   ```bash
	   pip install flask
	   ```

	2. Run the Flask app:  
	   ```bash
	   python app.py
	   ```

	3. Open your browser and go to:  
	   ```
	   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
	   ```

	## Notes
	- `messages.txt` is included to show where messages are saved.  
	- You can clear its content anytime.
